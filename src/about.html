		<h1> A bit about me: </h1>
		<h2> I am Karthik.</h2>
		<p>I am enthusiast in almost everything and I want to be everything. I realized its tough to be good at everything based on neuroscience and I have decided to be computer enthusiast. Soon nature and its algorithms attracted me and tried to understand natural computing algorithms. But now I have narrowed down my attention to more concise topic with a long term goal on Neuroscience and computational aspects of Neurons. Recent advent in HTM (Heirarchical Temporal Memory) is helping me to understand why we have biased opinions about anything and why we cant do anything about it when one behaves so. Intelligence aspects of us make me rethink about free will. 
			Apart from Numenta's HTM algorithm I was always interested in how computers work. High performance computing, Software Reliability, Computing systems are my topics of interest through out my masters.</p>
