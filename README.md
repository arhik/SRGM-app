Software Reliability Growth Modeling

SRGM is an application to assess the quality of a software based on testing-failure data.

SRGM is also a platform for fellow researchers to contribute their own models (Software Reliability Growth Models)

The application is based on the webpack version of Aurelia Skeleton.

The background computations are done by python code and Tornado is used for serving purposes.

Dependencies:
	> Node

The following are Aurelia setup instructions borrowed directly from Aurelia README: 

Before you start, make sure you have a working [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment, preferably with NPM 3.

From the project folder, execute the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to
build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally.

To run the app execute the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Webpack development server that serves the built bundles.
You can now browse the skeleton app at http://localhost:3000. Changes in the code
will automatically build and reload the app.

> **Note**: when using NPM 2.x, you might encounter a run-time error like '_aureliaPal.DOM.injectStyles is not a function'.
To work around this issue, execute the command *npm dedupe*.

## Bundling

To build a development bundle (output to /build) execute:

```shell
npm run build
```

To build an optimized, minified production bundle (output to /dist) execute:

```shell
npm run prod
```

The production bundle includes all files that are required for deployment.

## Testing
To run the unit tests:

```shell
npm run test
```

> **Note**: The e2e tests aren't working yet
